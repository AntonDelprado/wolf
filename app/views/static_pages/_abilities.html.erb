<h2>Abilities</h2>

<p>Abilities are miscellaneous strengths that a character is trained in or naturally possesses. Unlike skills, abilities do not have a level and so a character either possesses an ability or not.</p>

<p>Characters use their synergy bonuses to purchase abilities. Purchasing abilities does not reduce the bonus to skills that synergies supply. Abilities are either tied to a synergy or are classless. Classless abilities cost two synergy points. Abilities with a synergy class cost two synergy points of that class or three of any other classes. Every character gets one skill for free that may be of any class.</p>

<p>Characters may use abilities they do not have. However the result suffers from an untrained penalty. Under most circumstances the result class is one lower than the one they roll. Under some circumstances the GM may rule that this penalty is larger or characters may be prevented from using the untrained ability at all.</p>
