<h2>Synergy Classes</h2>

<p>Most skills belong to a synergy class. Points spent within a synergy class give a bonus to all other skills in that class as long as at least one point is spent on that skill. The bonuses provided by synergy classes do not affect requirements and are calculated before all bonuses and buffs including their own bonuses. For each 10 skill levels purchased in a synergy class, each skill in that class gains a bonus level.</p>
